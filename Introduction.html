		First one is Han bok that is very big so it's good to wear and the colour is very beautiful.Han bok isn't just wonderful but a very useful and proud clothes.<br>
		Next one is Korean food for example Kimchi, Bulgogi and Bibimbap. People can think of it is too spicy, but I like foods that I do not like to spicy.
		Esspeically, Bulgogi is the most favorite food for foreigners. It's delicious and sweet.<br>
		And there are many palaces and temples in Korea, especially in Seoul. These days, many foreigners visit the palace with Hanbok.<br>
		There is the tower of Namsan in Seoul. It is my favorite sights. Because it has very beautiful at night.<br><br>
